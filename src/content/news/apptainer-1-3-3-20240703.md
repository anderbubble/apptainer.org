We are happy to announce that [Apptainer version 1.3.3](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/tag/v1.3.3) is now available.

In addition to bug fixes and other relatively minor changes, this version updates the minimum golang version to 1.21 and removes support for EL7.

As always, please report any problems as an [issue on github](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/issues).
